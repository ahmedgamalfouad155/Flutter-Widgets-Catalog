# 📘 Flutter Widgets Catalog Demos  

This project is a **learning playground** built while studying the **Flutter Widgets Catalog**.  
It demonstrates some Flutter widgets that were new to me, by creating a simple home screen with navigation to individual demo pages.  

Each button on the home screen represents a widget, and when tapped, it opens a dedicated page showing a practical example of how that widget works.
